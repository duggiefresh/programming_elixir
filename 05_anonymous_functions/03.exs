# The operator `rem(a, b)` returns the remained after dividing `a` by `b`. Write
# a function that takes a single integer `(n)` and calss the function in the previous
# exercise, passing it `rem(n, 3)`, `rem(n, 5)`, and `n`. Call it seven times with the
# arguments `10`, `11`, `12`, and so on. You should get "Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz,
# 16."
